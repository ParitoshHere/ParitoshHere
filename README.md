# 👋 Welcome to My GitHub!

I'm a B.Tech student with a passion for learning and exploring the world of coding.

🌱 Currently, I'm getting started with programming, primarily using Python and C. I'm excited to embark on this coding journey and develop new skills.

📚 While I may not have any projects to showcase just yet, my GitHub will be a reflection of my growth as a programmer. I'll be adding new projects and code as I learn and progress.
